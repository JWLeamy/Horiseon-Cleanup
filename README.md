## Technologies Used

1. HTML - used to create and structure the given webpage
2. CSS - used to modify the presentation and style of the given webpage
3. Git - used to clone down the original code prior to making modifications
4. Github - used to create this repository, modify and eventually commit each change made, and ultimately deploy the fully edited webpage. 

## Summary
The goal of this assignment was to use my newly developed HTML and CSS skillset to revise a set of code. While the original code displayed the same webpage image as seen above, it's format was unorganized, unsemantic, and contained many unnecessary lines of code. I fixed all of these issues without modifying the original layout of the webpage. 

## Steps
1. I carefully reviewed the many 'Div' tags included in the original code, and swapped them out accordingly to create a semantic HTML layout. (This included adding basic structure tags such as 'main', 'aside', 'section', 'footer', and more)
2. I cut out any class attributes, ID attributes, and other tags that took up space unnecessarily (also addded alt tags to images and icons).
3. Because I changed so many tags, I had to restructure the CSS style sheet to match the proper references. This not only meant adding changes, but deleted repetitive references.  
4. Aswell as carefully marking my progress within the code, I made sure to consistently commit my work to github with descreptive captions about my progress.
